	<h3>Early Life</h3>
	<p>Jeremy was born in Ohio. This was not a terribly influential experience for him because he only lived there for a few years. He soon moved to a suburb in the greater Boston area where, aside from a few excursions, he would remain for the rest of his life. </p>

	<h3>Middle Years</h3>
	<p>Jeremy's middle years, in middle and high school, were fairly mundane. The one exception to this was the year that he spent in New Zealand during 8th grade. This was a truly wonderful experience and he would recommend traveling there to basically anyone. Jeremy also picked up the clarinet during this period and participated in concert and marching band.  </p>

	<h3>Now and the Future</h3>
	<p>At some point during senior year of high school, Jeremy managed to apply to and get accepted to Tufts University where he no attends. This has been a very good experience for Jeremy.
